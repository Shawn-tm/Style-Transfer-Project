# Style-Transfer-Project
This repository uses a convolutional neural network to transfer style onto content images. 

The file titled "Picture Exploratory Analysis.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook which provides an initial analysis on images, compiles image pixels into a dataframe, and shows the intensity values of each image based on different color channels.

The file titled "Project 2 Milestone Report.pdf" is a pdf copy of my final report which goes into further depth on the thought processes for my model and descriptions for how the model works. 

The file titled "Style Transfrer Project Slides.pdf" is a pdf copy of my project slides, which provides a visual explanation of my project to complement my report.

The file titled "Style_Transfer_1.ipynb" contains the code used to create the neural network and implement the model on local images.
